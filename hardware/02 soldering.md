This tutorial will teach you how to solder

## Soldering Iron

This is the main device for soldering. It will generate heat on its tip and melt the solder to connect components together.

We suggest you to set temperature to 300-310 ℃ for normal soldering, temperature higher than 320 ℃ may causes the pad on the board tear off and components damaged, especially microcontroller unit (MCU).

And **REMEMBER** to **TURN OFF** the soldering iron when you leave.

Below is the introduction of soldering iron.

### Soldering Iron Handle

**DON'T TOUCH the metal part of the soldering iron handle when the soldering iron is on**

If you did your soldering job like this beautiful woman, your hand will have a serious burn injury, because the metal part of the soldering iron handle has a very high temperature when the soldering iron is on.

So **DON'T** be stupid.

### Soldering Iron tip

It is the tip that we melt and coat solder on it, remember to clean the tip with moisture sponge before and after you use it.

There are different type of soldering iron tip, we mostly use K type soldering iron tip for normal component soldering and 3C type soldering iron tip for high density pin component soldering, like MCU and regulator soldering.

## Solder

Solder is a metal alloy used to create a bond between components. It has a low melting point than other metal. We will use soldering iron to melt the solder to make connection between components.

## Flux

Flux is a flowing agent in soldering. It will lower the melting point of the solder. We will use it on soldering component with high density pin, as it allows solder flowing between the pins and without sticking them together.

There are two type of flux in lab, one is soft flux.

And one is hard flux.

They are both the same.

## Tweezer

There are mainly two type of tweezer you will find in the lab, one is straight

And one is curved

You will use tweezer to pick the component, place it to the correct place and fix its position while soldering.

## Soldering

After introducing all the tools you will need to use during soldering, it's the time to learn how to solder components.
