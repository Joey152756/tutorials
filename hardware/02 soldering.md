### Soldering Iron Handle

**DON'T TOUCH the metal part of the soldering iron handle when the soldering iron is on**

If you did your soldering job like this beautiful woman, your hand will have a serious burn injury.

So **DON'T** be stupid.

### Soldering Iron tip

It is the tip that we melt and coat solder on it, remember to clean the tip with moisture sponge before and after you use it.

There are different type of soldering iron tip, we mostly use K type soldering iron tip for normal component soldering and 3C type soldering iron tip for high density pin component soldering.

## Solder

Solder is a metal alloy used to create a bond between components. It has a low melting point than other metal. We will use soldering iron to melt the solder to make connection between components.

## Flux

Flux is a flowing agent in soldering. It will lower the melting point of the solder. We will use it on soldering component with high density pin, like microcontroller unit (MCU) and regulator, as it allows solder flowing between the pins and without sticking them together.

There are two type of flux in lab, one is soft flux.

And one is hard flux.

They are both the same.
