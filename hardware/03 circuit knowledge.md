This tutorial will teach you some basic circuit knowledge and three basic circuit.

## Pull UP

Pull up circuit is a circuit that a pull-up resistor connect the logic signal to high potential. It keeps the logic level of signal to high when the state is not set.

## Pull Down

Pull down circuit is similar to pull up circuit, but there is a pull-down resistor connect the logic signal to ground instead. It keeps the logic level of signal to low when the state is not set.
